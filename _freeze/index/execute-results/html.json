Its sustainable brands, such as **Brita**, **Burt’s Bees**, and **Green Works**, have gained significant consumer trust for their eco-friendly and socially responsible practices [@Recognitions].\n\n---\n\nIn August 2023, Clorox experienced a severe **cyberattack** [@mascellinoCloroxOperationsDisrupted2023] that disrupted its IT systems and operations. The attack, which was detected on August 14, forced the company to take affected systems offline, leading to significant production delays and supply chain disruptions. Clorox activated its business continuity plans, reverting to manual processes for order fulfillment and customer communications.  \n\nThe cyberattack had a material financial impact, with Clorox reporting a 23-28% decline in quarterly sales and a drop in its stock price by over 25% following the incident.\n\nClorox’s response to the cyberattack highlighted its crisis management capabilities. The company maintained transparency by providing regular updates to stakeholders and implementing phased recovery plans to restore operations safely. Brand and reputation were not severely damaged in the process. \n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nWe can use modern LLM chatbots to collect publicly available sources and perform analysis of the company personality.

Luckily, many tools are available for us to experiment with.\n\nWe've already done some simple short-term forecasting in our \"Technical Analysis\" section using **SMA** and **Bollinger Bands**. We've also accessed volatility by calculating **Beta** value and estimated risk/return using **Annualized Sharpe Ratio**, which might help us in medium-term forecasting.
