* What risks does it list on 10-k? Summarize.

Long-term financial forecasting, like all social forecasting, is an incredibly fraught undertaking due to many different reasons (see, for example, [@cerqueira8ReasonsWhy2022] and [@ForecastingPredictiveAnalytics]). Luckily, many tools are available for us to experiment with.

We've already done some simple short-term forecasting in our "Technical Analysis" section using **SMA** and **Bollinger Bands**. We've also accessed volatility by calculating **Beta** value and estimated risk/return using **Annualized Sharpe Ratio**, which might help us in medium-term forecasting. Now we will try using advanced **ARIMA** (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages) to predict stock prices for the next 6 months and for the next year.

```{r} 
library(tidyquant)
library(forecast)
library(ggplot2)
library(timetk)
library(dplyr)

clx_stock <- tq_get("CLX", 
                   get = "stock.prices", 
                   from = "2020-01-01", 
                   to = "2025-02-01") |>
  select(date, close) |>
  arrange(date)

clx_price_ts <- tk_ts(clx_stock, start = 2020, 
              frequency = 252)

arima_model <- auto.arima(clx_price_ts)

arima_forecast <- forecast(arima_model, h = 365/2)

autoplot(arima_forecast) +
  labs(title = "CLX Stock Price Forecast 6 Months (ARIMA)",
    y = "Price (USD)",
    x = "Date") +
  theme_minimal()

arima_forecast <- forecast(arima_model, h = 365)

autoplot(arima_forecast) +
  labs(title = "CLX Stock Price Forecast Year (ARIMA)",
       y = "Price (USD)",
       x = "Date") +
  theme_minimal()
```

We can see the band for the future time periods representing possible price ranges and 2 confidence levels.
