#### **I. Graham Number Calculation**  
The Graham Number estimates a stock’s intrinsic value using earnings per share (EPS) and book value per share (BVPS):  
**Formula**:  

$$\text{Graham Number} = \sqrt{22.5 \times \text{EPS} \times \text{BVPS}}$$

- **EPS (TTM)**: $3.67   
- **BVPS**: $0.98 (Total Equity: $121M / Shares Outstanding: 123.19M)   
- **Calculation**:  
$$\sqrt{22.5 \times 3.67 \times 0.98} = \sqrt{80.92} \approx \boxed{8.99}$$
- **Interpretation**: CLX’s current stock price (~$149.61) far exceeds the Graham Number, indicating potential overvaluation based on traditional metrics .

#### **III. Key Insights**  
1. **Profitability**: Margins are recovering post-cyberattack, but net margins lag competitors. Gross margin improved to 43.8% in Q2 FY25, with cost savings offsetting inflation .  
2. **Liquidity Risks**: Low current (0.94) and quick (0.52) ratios highlight liquidity challenges, though improved cash flow ($401M YTD) provides relief .  
3. **Debt Concerns**: Debt-to-equity (25.55) and debt-to-assets (98%) ratios signal high leverage, though interest coverage (11.7x) remains manageable .  
4. **Valuation**: Elevated P/E (40.5) and P/B (61.19) suggest market optimism about Clorox’s recovery, but Graham Number ($8.99) implies overvaluation .  
5. **Dividend Strength**: A 3.26% yield with consistent growth underscores Clorox’s defensive appeal, despite a high payout ratio (133%) .

#### **IV. Conclusion**  
Clorox’s fundamentals reflect a company in recovery, balancing strong brand equity and dividend reliability with significant debt and valuation risks. While operational improvements (e.g., margin expansion, ERP transition) are promising, the stock’s premium pricing and leverage warrant caution. Investors should monitor debt reduction and margin sustainability in 2025 .
