#### **6. Key Insights**
- Clorox’s valuation (P/E 40.6) reflects optimism about its recovery and IGNITE strategy but is expensive compared to peers .
- Consumer Staples sector growth (CAGR 3.7% for cleaning products) supports long-term stability, but competition from eco-friendly brands (e.g., Seventh Generation) poses risks .
- Clorox’s underperformance vs. indices highlights sector-specific challenges (inflation, supply chain) .

For real-time data, update the R code with current ticker prices and adjust the date range. The analysis underscores Clorox’s resilience in a defensive sector but signals caution due to margin pressures and competitive headwinds.
