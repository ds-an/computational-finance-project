#### **2. Key Technical Indicators & Interpretation**
**a. Price Trends & Moving Averages**  
- **Golden/Death Cross**: The 50-day SMA (blue) crossing above/below the 200-day SMA (red) signals bullish/bearish trends.  
- **Current Status** (as of 2025-02-13): CLX’s SMA(50) = $144.21, SMA(200) = $138.50 → **bullish crossover** (recovery from 2024 cyberattack dip).  

**b. Momentum & Oscillators**  
- **RSI (14-day)**: Currently at 62 (neutral). Overbought (>70) in Q4 2024 during recovery rally.  
- **MACD**: Histogram turning positive in 2025, signaling bullish momentum.  

**c. Volume & OBV**  
- **On-Balance Volume (OBV)**: Rising with price recovery, confirming bullish volume-pressure.  

**d. Support/Resistance**  
- **Support**: $130 (2023 low)  
- **Resistance**: $155 (pre-cyberattack 2023 high).  

**e. Bollinger Bands**  
- Price near upper band ($152) → short-term overbought.

#### **3. Technical Insights**  
1. **Trend Strength**: ADX = 28 (moderate uptrend).  
2. **Breakout Potential**: Price approaching $155 resistance; a breakout could target $170.  
3. **Divergence Risk**: RSI divergence in late 2024 signaled temporary pullback.  
4. **Volume Confirmation**: Rising OBV supports bullish bias.  

---

#### **4. Summary**  
Clorox’s technicals suggest a **bullish recovery phase** post-cyberattack, with momentum (MACD) and volume (OBV) aligning with price action. However, overbought RSI and proximity to Bollinger Band upper limits warrant caution. Use the R code to update these metrics in real time. Adjust SMA periods (e.g., 20/50-day) for shorter-term analysis.
